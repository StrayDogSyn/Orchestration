## 🎯 Research Objectives

### 1. Pedagogical Research (Gemini)
- Learning theory for justice-impacted students
- Self-paced curriculum design
- Assessment strategies
- Retention techniques

### 2. Technical Research (Gemini)
- LLM orchestration patterns
- Free-tier tool capabilities
- Production architecture patterns
- Multi-agent systems

### 3. Market Research (Perplexity)
- AI job market analysis
- Second-chance employer database
- Competitive bootcamp analysis
- Free-tier tool ecosystem

## 📋 Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Execute Prompts
1. Open [RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md](RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md)
2. Run Gemini prompts (1-3) → Save to `gemini-responses/`
3. Run Perplexity prompts (4-5) → Save to `perplexity-responses/`

### Phase 2: Validate
1. Check all Perplexity citations (links work?)
2. Cross-reference findings across responses
3. Note contradictions for resolution

### Phase 3: Synthesize
1. Extract key findings from each response
2. Create synthesis documents in `synthesis/`
3. Map findings to curriculum modules

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Response files are NOT committed** (too large, in `.gitignore`)
- **Only README files and prompts** are version controlled
- **Synthesized insights** are committed to `synthesis/`
- **Validate all citations** before including in curriculum
