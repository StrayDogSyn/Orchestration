## 🔧 Technical Issues

### Q: My API key isn't working / I got a 429 Error.
**A:** You hit the rate limit.
1.  Check if you are sending requests too fast. Implement the "Exponential Backoff" code from Module 1, Lecture 6.
2.  Check if your free trial expired.
3.  Switch to a different provider (e.g., from Gemini to Claude) as a fallback.

### Q: Can I use ChatGPT (OpenAI)?
**A:** Yes, but be careful.
*   **GPT-4o-mini** has a free tier/cheap API.
*   **GPT-4** is paid ($20/mo).
*   **Constraint:** You must ensure your project *can* run on free tools. If you build something that *only* works on GPT-4, you failed the Zero-Cost Mandate.

### Q: I'm on an old laptop. Can I do this?
**A:** Yes!
*   We use cloud APIs (Gemini/Claude), so the "heavy lifting" happens on Google/Anthropic's servers, not your laptop.
*   If VS Code is too slow, use **Google Colab** (runs in your browser).

## 📚 Learning & Content

### Q: Why isn't there a video for every single step?
**A:** We are training you to be an **Architect**.

*   An Architect figures things out.
*   If we spoon-fed you every step, you wouldn't learn to survive in the wild.

### Q: Can I skip Module 1? I know Python.
**A:** No.
*   Module 1 isn't just Python. It's **AI Orchestration**.
*   Do you know how to debug LLM hallucinations? Do you know Big O applied to token costs?
*   Prove it by completing the Capstone.

## 💼 Career & Jobs

### Q: Will this get me a job?
**A:** No course "gets" you a job. **You** get you a job.
*   This course gives you a **Portfolio**.
*   When an employer asks "Do you know AI?", you won't say "Yes."
*   You will say, "Here is my Personal AI Agent Platform. It handles model routing, memory, and tool execution. Let me show you the code."

### Q: What is a "Justice-Impacted" developer?
**A:** Anyone who has faced barriers to employment due to the justice system.
*   We believe in second chances.
*   We believe skills > background.
*   This curriculum is designed to give you the strongest possible skills to overcome those barriers.
