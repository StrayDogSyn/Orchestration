# Learning Strategies
**How to Succeed in This Course**

This course is different. We don't grade you on memorization. We grade you on **Evolution**.

## 🧠 Strategy 1: The "Chinese Room" Check
When you use AI to generate code, stop and ask yourself:
> *"If the internet went down right now, could I explain how this code works to a 5-year-old?"*

If the answer is **No**, you are trapped in the Chinese Room. You are an Operator, not an Architect.
**Action:** Delete the code. Ask the AI to explain the *concept*, then write the code yourself.

## 📝 Strategy 2: Prompt Logging
Treat your prompts like source code.
*   **Bad:** Typing random questions into ChatGPT and losing them.
*   **Good:** Saving your prompts in a text file (`prompts.md`).
*   **Why:** When you find a "magic prompt" that works perfectly, you want to be able to use it again. This is your "Spellbook."

## 🛑 Strategy 3: The "Stuck" Protocol
When you get stuck (and you will):
1.  **5-Minute Rule:** Try to solve it yourself for 5 minutes. Read the error message.
2.  **Rubber Duck:** Explain the problem out loud to your screen.
3.  **Architect Prompt:** Ask the AI, but *don't ask for the solution*. Ask for a hint.
    *   *Bad:* "Fix this error."
    *   *Good:* "I'm getting a KeyError. Explain what causes a KeyError in Python dictionaries, but don't fix my code yet."

## 🔄 Strategy 4: Spaced Repetition
You will build a "Learning Flashcard System" in Module 4. Use it!
*   Every time you learn a new concept (e.g., "Exponential Backoff"), add it to your system.
*   Review your cards before starting a new module.

## 🏆 Strategy 5: Portfolio First
Don't worry about "finishing the course." Worry about **building the portfolio**.
*   Employers don't care if you watched 100% of the videos.
*   They care that your **Code Explainer** tool actually works.
*   Focus on the Capstone projects. Make them bulletproof.
