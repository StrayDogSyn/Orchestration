- ❌ No traditional exams
- ❌ No multiple choice tests
- ✅ Working code proves mastery
- ✅ Clear rubrics with understanding criteria
- ✅ Portfolio-ready deliverables

### Rubric Categories

| Category | Weight | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Technical Execution | 40% | Does it work? |
| Design Rationale | 30% | Why these choices? |
| Code Quality | 20% | Readable, handles errors? |
| Understanding | 10% | Can you explain it? |
