## 🏆 The Capstone Project

### Personal AI Agent Platform

Your capstone is a fully functional AI agent platform that demonstrates everything you've learned:

#### Core Requirements

| Feature | Module Source | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Foundation | Module 01 | Sound architectural decisions |
| Prompt System | Module 02 | Production-grade prompts |
| Model Router | Module 03 | Intelligent model selection |
| Memory System | Module 04 | RAG and knowledge storage |
| Agent Layer | Module 05 | Multi-agent orchestration |

#### Capabilities

Your platform must be able to:

- 🔀 **Route tasks** to optimal free-tier models
- 🧠 **Maintain memory** (conversation + long-term knowledge)
- ⚡ **Execute actions** (code, API calls, tool use)
- 📖 **Self-document** its architecture and decisions
- 🌱 **Evolve** as you continue developing

## 📅 Timeline

- Architecture planning
- Component specification
- Technical design document

### Phase 2: Core Build (Weeks 18-20)
- Model router implementation
- Memory system integration
- Basic agent functionality

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 21-22)
- Tool integration
- Multi-agent coordination
- Error handling & resilience

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 23-24)
- Documentation
- Testing & refinement
- Portfolio presentation

## 📊 Assessment Rubric

| Category | Weight | Criteria |
