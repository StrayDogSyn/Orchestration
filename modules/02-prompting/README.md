> Prompt engineering as a programming discipline

## 📋 Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | Weeks 4-6 (3 weeks) |
| Prerequisites | Module 01: Foundations |
| Difficulty | Intermediate |
| Assessment | Project-based |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Design prompts as functions** with clear inputs, outputs, and error handling
2. **Implement chain-of-thought reasoning** for complex problem decomposition
3. **Apply role-based prompting** following interface segregation principles
4. **Version and iterate** on prompts systematically
5. **Identify and avoid** common prompt anti-patterns
6. **Build a reusable prompt library** with documented design patterns
