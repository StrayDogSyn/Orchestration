# Beta Test Protocol: Lecture 01

**Tester**: Hunter (Self-Test)  
**Date**: December 23, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This protocol guides you through a structured self-test of Lecture 01. The goal is to identify friction points, validate time estimates, and determine if the core concepts land.

**Key Mindset**: You are NOT testing as the course creator. You are testing as **a bootcamp graduate who's curious about AI but unsure how it fits into their workflow**.

## 📤 What to Do With This Log

After completing your self-test:

1. **Save this file** with your completed responses
2. **Share with Claude** for analysis and recommendations
3. **Prioritize fixes** based on severity ratings
4. **Decide on next steps** (Phase 2 or revision)

## 🎯 Remember

**Finding issues is success.** 

A "perfect" beta test where everything works means we didn't test hard enough. The whole point is to find friction before real students do.

Be brutally honest. Your past self will thank you.
