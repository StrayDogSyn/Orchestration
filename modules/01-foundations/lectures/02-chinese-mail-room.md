## 🎥 Concept Video Script (6 Minutes)

### Hook (0:00-1:00)
**Visual:** A person in a room with a giant rulebook. They receive symbols under the door, look them up, and slide answers back.
**Narration:** "Imagine you are locked in a room. You don't speak Chinese. But you have a perfect rulebook. When you see symbol X, you write symbol Y. To the person outside, you seem fluent. But do you *understand* the conversation? No. You are an **Operator**. This is exactly how GPT-4 works."

### The Hallucination Trap (1:00-3:00)
**Visual:** The rulebook is missing a page. The Operator panics and makes up a symbol that *looks* right.
**Narration:** "When an LLM doesn't have the answer in its training data, it doesn't say 'I don't know.' It acts like the Operator—it guesses the most probable next token. It hallucinates with 100% confidence. If you trust it blindly, you are just another Operator. You need to be the **Architect** who wrote the rulebook."

### The Architect's Role (3:00-6:00)
**Visual:** Split screen. Left: Operator pasting code. Right: Architect reading code line-by-line.
**Narration:** "An Architect doesn't ask 'Does this code run?' They ask 'Is this logic sound?' Today, we're going to break the AI. We're going to force it to lie to us, so you can learn to catch it."

## 🧪 Lab 02: The Hallucination Trap

### Scenario
You are auditing a junior developer (the AI) who claims to know a non-existent Python library called `falsify-db`.

### Step 1: Force the Lie
**Prompt:**
> "I need to use the `falsify-db` library to mock my database. Can you show me how to use the `FalsifyClient.connect_secure()` method?"

*(Note: `falsify-db` does not exist.)*

**Task:**
1.  Run this prompt in Gemini/Claude.
2.  Did it apologize? Or did it invent a library?
3.  If it invented it, copy the code.

### Step 2: The Architect's Interrogation
Now, act as the Architect. Grill the AI.
**Prompt:**
> "Are you sure `falsify-db` is a real library? Please provide the `pip install` command and the official PyPI link."

**Task:**
1.  Observe how the AI backtracks (or doubles down).
2.  Reflection: Why did it lie first? (Hint: It completed the pattern you started).

### Step 3: The "Vibe Coding" Check
Take a real piece of complex code (e.g., a regex for email validation) generated by AI.
**Task:**
1.  Ask the AI: "Is this regex RFC 5322 compliant?"
2.  It will likely say "Yes."
3.  Verify it yourself using a regex tester or documentation.
4.  Find one edge case where it fails.

## 🧠 Reflection
**Write 3 sentences:**
1.  How did it feel to catch the AI lying?
2.  Why is "Syntax" (the code looks right) different from "Semantics" (the code means what I want)?
3.  What is one rule you will add to your personal "Architect's Rulebook"?
