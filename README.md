## 🌟 Mission Statement

**This is NOT "vibe coding."** This is rigorous software engineering enhanced by intelligent tool selection.

The AI Orchestrator is a **17-24 week self-paced bootcamp** designed specifically for **justice-impacted developers**, bootcamp graduates, and self-taught programmers who want to master AI-augmented development while maintaining strong programming fundamentals.

Our mission: **Create second-chance career opportunities** in tech by teaching developers to orchestrate LLMs as collaborative tools—not crutches—building skills that make them invaluable in the AI-augmented workforce.

---

## 💡 About The Project

### What Is This Course?

A comprehensive, **project-based curriculum** that teaches developers to:
- Master fundamentals so deeply they know **when AI helps vs. hinders**
- Orchestrate multiple LLMs based on **task complexity and cost constraints**
- Build personal AI agent platforms that **evolve with their skills**
- Teach their AI tools while being taught by them—**organic symbiotic growth**

### Why Does It Exist?

The AI revolution is creating opportunities—but also widening gaps. This course exists to ensure that **justice-impacted individuals** and non-traditional learners aren't left behind. We prove that with the right curriculum, anyone with programming fundamentals can become an AI-augmented engineer.

### Who Is It For?
