# Project Philosophy Digest
**Project:** The AI Orchestrator
**Target Audience:** Justice-impacted developers & second-chance learners

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Fundamentals First"
The central thesis of this course is that **AI tools make computer science fundamentals *more* valuable, not less.** 
- **The "Chinese Room" Problem:** AI models (like the person in Searle's room) follow rules and match patterns without true understanding. They can generate code, but they cannot judge its correctness, efficiency, or safety.
- **The Architect's Role:** The human developer must shift from being a "syntax writer" to an "architect." The architect designs the rules, validates the outputs, and orchestrates the AI. Without strong fundamentals (Big O, data structures, system design), a developer cannot effectively evaluate or guide the AI.

## 2. The "Chinese Room Architect" Framework
This pedagogical framework defines the student's relationship with AI:
1.  **AI as Operator:** The AI is the tireless worker in the room, processing symbols and generating outputs based on training patterns.
2.  **Student as Architect:** The student designs the "room" (the system/architecture), writes the "rulebook" (prompts/instructions), and verifies the "output" (code review/testing).
3.  **Dependency Trap:** If the student relies on the AI without understanding, they become a dependent user, not an orchestrator. Mastery requires the ability to work *without* the AI, so one can effectively work *with* it.

## 3. The Zero-Cost Mandate
**Constraint:** Every tool, platform, and resource used in the course must be **free**.
- **Reasoning:** To remove all financial barriers for justice-impacted individuals who may have limited resources.
- **Implementation:**
    - **Compute:** Google Colab (Free Tier), Local Machines.
    - **LLMs:** Gemini Pro (Free API), Claude (Free Tier), OpenAI (Free Tier/$5 credit).
    - **IDE:** VS Code, Cursor (Free).
    - **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, Vercel (Free).
    - **DB:** ChromaDB (Local), MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier).

## 4. Target Audience & Barriers
- **Primary Persona:** Justice-impacted individuals, bootcamp graduates, self-taught developers.
- **Prerequisites:** Basic OOP, Algorithms, Data Structures (Python/JS).
- **Barriers to Entry:**
    - **Financial:** Cannot afford paid subscriptions (Copilot, ChatGPT Plus).
    - **Hardware:** May be working on older/limited hardware.
    - **Confidence:** "Imposter syndrome" exacerbated by the "Digital Cliff."
    - **Employment:** Facing stigma and background check hurdles; need portfolio-based proof of skills.

## 5. Pedagogical Approach: Micro-Mastery
- **Structure:** 6-minute concept video -> Active Recall Quiz -> 30-minute Hands-on Lab -> Metacognitive Reflection.
- **Goal:** Rapid, verifiable skill acquisition that builds confidence.
- **Assessment:** Project-based. "Working code = proof of mastery." No multiple-choice exams as final proof.

## 6. Operational Guidelines
- **Build with Heart:** This is not just a coding course; it's a pathway to a second chance.
- **Rigor:** Do not "dumb down" the content. High expectations + high support = high achievement.
- **Organic Evolution:** The course itself is built via Human-AI collaboration (Hunter + Claude), demonstrating the very method it teaches.
