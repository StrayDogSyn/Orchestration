# Module 1 Learning Objectives: Foundations
**Theme:** Why Fundamentals Matter MORE in the AI Age
**Duration:** 3 Weeks (Self-Paced)
**Prerequisites:** Basic OOP, Python syntax, Big O awareness

## 🎯 Primary Learning Objectives
By the end of Module 1, students will be able to:

### 1. Evaluate AI Solutions using Algorithmic Complexity [Bloom: Evaluate]
*   **Sub-skill A:** Identify O(n) vs O(n²) complexity in AI-generated code snippets.
*   **Sub-skill B:** Select the appropriate LLM model (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus) based on task complexity and "token budget" (Big O for cost).
*   **Assessment:** "Big O Audit" Lab - Students rank 3 AI solutions by efficiency and cost.

### 2. Architect "Chinese Room" Verification Systems [Bloom: Create]
*   **Sub-skill A:** Differentiate between "vibe coding" (blind acceptance) and "architecting" (rule-based verification).
*   **Sub-skill B:** Design prompts that require the AI to explain its logic ("Show Your Work").
*   **Assessment:** Reflection Essay analyzing a failure where the AI generated correct-looking but buggy code.

### 3. Debug Non-Deterministic AI Outputs [Bloom: Analyze]
*   **Sub-skill A:** Apply standard debugging techniques (print, breakpoints) to prompt chains.
*   **Sub-skill B:** Identify hallucination patterns in technical explanations.
*   **Assessment:** "Fix the AI" Lab - Students are given a broken AI-generated script and must fix it without generating new code.

### 4. Orchestrate Basic Human-AI Workflows [Bloom: Apply]
*   **Sub-skill A:** Use the "Prompt as Function" mental model to modularize interactions.
*   **Sub-skill B:** Implement a simple "Human-in-the-loop" validation step for critical code.
*   **Assessment:** Capstone Project - Personal Code Explainer tool.

### 5. Navigate the Free-Tier Ecosystem [Bloom: Apply]
*   **Sub-skill A:** Configure API keys and environment variables securely.
*   **Sub-skill B:** Handle rate limits and API errors gracefully in code.
*   **Assessment:** Environment Setup Lab - Successfully connecting to Gemini/Claude APIs with error handling.

## 🧠 Metacognitive Goals
*   **Shift Identity:** From "Coder" to "Architect."
*   **Build Confidence:** Realize that AI makes their fundamental knowledge *more* valuable.
*   **Develop Skepticism:** Trust but verify every output.
