# Lecture 01 Beta Testing Protocol
**For: Hunter Hall (Self-Test)**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Test Lecture 01 as if you're a student with:
- 6 months of prior coding experience
- Bootcamp grad level (OOP, basic algorithms)
- Some AI tool exposure but no formal training
- Realistic time constraints (busy schedule, competing priorities)

**Goal**: Find friction, confusion, and "I'd give up here" moments BEFORE real students encounter them.

## 🔧 Issue Severity Classification

Use this rubric when logging issues:

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Blocks learning completely | Code doesn't run, concept is wrong, instructions are incomprehensible |
| **P1 - High** | Causes significant confusion or time loss | Jargon not defined, time estimate way off, unclear success criteria |
| **P2 - Medium** | Suboptimal UX but workaroundable | Better analogy exists, instructions could be clearer, pacing feels off |
| **P3 - Low** | Nice-to-have improvements | Typo, bonus content suggestion, formatting tweak |

**Triage Rule**: Fix all P0/P1 before moving to Lecture 02. P2/P3 can wait.

---

## 📝 Deliverables

After completing the beta test, export:

1. **Completed Beta Test Log** (all timestamps, friction points, feedback)
2. **Your actual lab answers** (the starter.md file you filled out)
3. **Issue Tracker** (table of all P0/P1/P2/P3 issues identified)
4. **Go/No-Go Recommendation**:
   - ✅ **GO**: Lecture is ready for real students (with minor revisions)
   - ⚠️ **GO WITH FIXES**: Needs specific changes but core concept works
   - ❌ **NO-GO**: Fundamental issues require redesign

## ⏱️ Time Budget

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Setup | 5 min |
| Concept Video Test | 8 min |
| Quiz Test | 10 min |
| Lab Test | 35 min |
| Reflection Test | 8 min |
| Post-Test Analysis | 10 min |
| **Total** | **76 minutes** |

**Note**: This is MORE than the 50-minute lecture because you're testing + logging, not just learning.

---

## 🚦 Success Criteria

This beta test is successful if:

- ✅ You complete all sections (even if you hit friction)
- ✅ You log every moment of confusion in real-time
- ✅ You provide a honest GO/NO-GO recommendation
- ✅ You identify at least 3 concrete improvements (there will be issues—that's the point!)
